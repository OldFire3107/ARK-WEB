# ARK-WEB
This is the website which is under development for aerial robotics kharagpur.
It is temporarily hosted on [this url](https://agnipurani.com/ARK-WEB).

## Things to note before you start working
* If you download this and one an html file, you may find the footer missing but no worries it will be displayed once it is hosted, so don't panic. To see the footer and make changes please look footer.html
* The navbar is not made into a standard file and should ideally be made so but till then if a chnage is made in the nav bar it much be made for all the webpages using it. The reason it is not done is because of the active page which would need some js.
* The blog page is not of that much priority as the blog can be created seperately (which is actually done on the original web-site using jekyll)
* Rather than cards on the index.html file another thing is preferred or make is responsive with differences for each card as it looks monotonus. If cards are planned to use remove the rounded border as its distracting for the visitor
